## Project: ForgetfulNUS

ForgetfulNUS is a flashcard application designed to assist students in learning the German Language, specifically those undertaking the NUS modules LAG1201 and LAG2201, as a memory aid for vocabulary.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort the glossary in multiple ways
  * What it does: allows the user to sort the glossary based on the parameter they input, such as by chronological or alphabetical order for instance.
  * Justification: This allows the user to navigate their glossary much more easily and adds another degree of customisability to the glossary.
  * Highlights: To implement sorting by chronological order, I created a new Order field to be used in every FlashCard. 
  
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=tjwjoe&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Performed significant refactoring of the original AB3 code at the start of the project to make it suit our product.
  * Added an Order field to each FlashCard to facilitate sorting by chronological order.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Ensured that the overall quality of the User Guide was maintained throughout the project.
    * Wrote usage guide for `sort` feature.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added documentation for the `sort` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the cohort (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  
* **Credits**:
  * This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative.
