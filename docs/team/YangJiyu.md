## Project: ForgetfulNUS

ForgetfulNUS is a desktop glossary app for students taking German 1 (LAG1201) and German 2 (LAG2201) in NUS to practise and test their vocabulary. This app is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, ForgetfulNUS can get your German revision done quickly and effectively.
