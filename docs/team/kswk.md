## Project: ForgetfulNUS

ForgetfulNUS is a **flashcard application** designed to assist students currently learning the **German Language**,
  specifically those undertaking the **NUS modules LAG1201 and LAG2201**, as a **memory aid for vocabulary**.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to quiz with a specified number of randomised flashcards.
  * What it does: allows the user to choose a specific number of flashcards from the existing glossary and start a quiz with the order of the flashcards randomised.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quiz himself/herself conveniently with a selected number of flashcards that he/she is comfortable with. Furthermore, the selected number of flashcards will be quizzed in no particular order due to randomisation instead of having the user quiz himself/herself through the entire German 1 and German 2 Glossary in the same order every time.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=kswk&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
