## Project: ForgetfulNUS

ForgetfulNUS is a **flashcard application** designed to assist students currently learning the **German Language**,
  specifically those undertaking the **NUS modules LAG1201 and LAG2201**, as a **memory aid for vocabulary**.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to quiz with a specified number of randomised flashcards.
  * What it does: allows the user to choose a specific number of flashcards from the existing glossary and start a quiz with the order of the flashcards randomised.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quiz himself/herself conveniently with a selected number of flashcards that he/she is comfortable with. Furthermore, the selected number of flashcards will be quizzed in no particular order due to randomisation instead of having the user quiz himself/herself through the entire German 1 and German 2 Glossary in the same order every time.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=kswk&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Contributed to the refactoring of Address Book - Level 3 to ForgetfulNUS [#87](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/commit/b7075d97eae784e099507da32b5f24ca86a30263)
  * Improved code quality and readability of the codebase. [#130](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/commit/2301588617e3b4dec90426aa5e711cd1689b328d)

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
